    "about_me_description":"First and foremost, I love writing code. Ever since writing my first program and manipulating it to get desired output, it was almost magic being able to get the computer to do whatever I wanted just by typing in these funny little symbols ,limited only by my own imagination and ingenuity. Being an electronic and telecommunication engineer and working as a software developer provide me a greater control over hardware and software."
